title: Display CTRL
description: A utility to control & inspect DDC/CI-enabled monitors. Originally developed to darken the backlight of two hardcoded monitors to allow audio to play while the screen is "off". I have since cleaned up the plethora of Rust `.unwrap()`'s and hardcoded values to now support setting arbitrary DDC/CI values of any supported monitor.
