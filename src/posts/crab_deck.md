subtitle: ~/web_dev/crab_deck
description: My Elgato Stream Deck stopped working one day, and so rather than buying a new one, I tried designing and building my own. It's powered by a Raspberry Pi equipped with a small touchscreen, and housed in a custom designed and 3d printed housing. Custom poured resin button caps are embedded inside a flexible silicone layer for tactile feedback when using the touchscreen.
